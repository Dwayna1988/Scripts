STILL UNCOMPLETE



____________MISC ISSUES:____________
Staff Office at -50 z no longer works.  I cant use telepads even though I am at the proper z .fix brings me to a z of 0 which should not happen.
	- Experimental=008|0080|0100|001


____________GUILD ISSUES:____________
~ warfare declare menu button is not working!

~ SERV.LOG TODO: GuildSys Teleport Stone

~ What is the <mastertitle>/how is it set? shows up on the main dialog and diff than character title.


-------------------------------------------------------------

~ wardeclare dialog should not show guilds we already declared on or show them differently (best way to tell this with the uid?)

~ Guildlist gump is not generating the full list of wewar guilds to rescind declarations (only the first guild)
	The <guild.#.name> is only showing <guild.0.name> but the 1 should exist too..

~ Declare peace is not generating the list of guilds you are at war with

~ searching for 'king' instead of the exact match 'King' will messed up the declare war gump
