____________GUILD ISSUES:____________

~ What is the <mastertitle>/how is it set? shows up on the main dialog and diff than character title.

~ wardeclare dialog should not show guilds we already declared on or show them differently (best way to tell this with the uid?)

~ searching for 'king' instead of the exact match 'King' will messed up the declare war gump
