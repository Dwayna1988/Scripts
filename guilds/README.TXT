DO NOT PUT THIS IN SPHERETABLES.SCP YET!!!
STILL UNCOMPLETE


____________GUILD ISSUES & IDEAS:____________
~ SERV.LOG TODO: GuildSys Teleport Stone

~ What is the <mastertitle>/how is it set? shows up on the main dialog and diff than character title.

~ wardeclare dialog should not show guilds we already declared on or show them differently (best way to tell this with the uid?)

~ searching for 'king' instead of the exact match 'King' will messed up the declare war gump

~ should we add a redeed option with defname to enable/disable? (no - teleport better... redeed is an hassle)

~ sphere_guild_dlg_warfaredialog.scp -> filter out already @ war / invited ?

~ add ally support, de-hardcode auto-ally on same align (order)

~ add guildspeak support
